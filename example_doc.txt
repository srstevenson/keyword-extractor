I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I
needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents
off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures. And then we're
gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your
mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't
understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick
with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of
them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our
enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and
Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and
forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and
Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever
100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every
minute, rickandmorty.com.
